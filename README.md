# SQL
Project "Base for an online store" in SQL: (Debian, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin)

Hey there! 👋

I'm working on a practical project showcasing my skills in Linux Debian 11 🐧, command-line operations 💻, software installation & removal 📦, and PostgreSQL 🛢️.

In this project, I will:
✅ Create a database and users 👤
✅ Execute basic SQL queries 🔍
✅ Write and run Bash scripts for automation ⚙️

This project will be useful for those who want to see key system administration and DevOps tools in action. 🔥

Planned completion date: January 25
